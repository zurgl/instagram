The nightmare
#linebreak()
of
#linebreak()
fabrication

#pagebreak()

I don't have many friends...
#linebreak()
The pain is unbearable pain.
#pagebreak()
There are always pools of blood in the shadows.
#linebreak()
I want to break the skull and take the pain out.

#pagebreak()

Pry the scab off with a nail and scoop the flesh out.
#linebreak()
#linebreak()
Let me get out of here.
